The data includes heat and wave scores from the 2014-2018 World Surf League Championship Tour seasons. 
The 2018 and 2014 Championship Tour season wave and heat scores were data-scraped from the official Championship Tour World Surf League website 
The heat scores were manipulated into two separate excel files. One file was named ’leaderboard’, that had 22 sheets, each event had a pre- and post-event sheet to track tier rankings for the surfers. 
The second excel document, named ’Historical Event surfer stats’, had 11 sheets, one per event, containing surfer statistics obtained from 2014-2016 WCT seasons. 
Exploratory data analysis was conducted on the 2017 season to build MILP models and develop team-selection strategies. 
These models were tested on the 2018 WCT season. 
The 2014-2016 WCT seasons were used as historical data in determining the important variables that predict surfer performance in the 2017 WCT season.

Note all data was anonymised due to ethical constraints
